                    <div>
                        Lagos Local provides a collection of online resources, including classified ads, forums,
                        catalogs,
                        and various email services available on or through Lagos Local (referred to hereafter as “the
                        Service”) subject to the following Terms of Use (“TOU”). By using the Service in any way, you
                        are
                        agreeing to comply with the TOU. In addition, when using particular Lagos Local services, you
                        agree
                        to abide by any applicable posted guidelines for all Lagos Local services, which may change from
                        time to time. Should you object to any term or condition of the TOU, any guidelines, or any
                        subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with the Service in any way, your only
                        recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.

                        We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and
                        conditions at any time. Such modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting
                        thereof. You must review this agreement on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes.

                    <div>
                        Lagos Local reserves some parts of the Service exclusively for professional purchasers, sellers,
                        collectors and resellers of items and accessories who are acceptable to Lagos Local in its sole
                        discretion. Although Lagos Local attempts to limit the use of these parts of the Service to such
                        purchasers, sellers, collectors and resellers of items and accessories, nothing herein shall create
                        any right of action against Lagos Local for failing to adequately screen potential users or prevent
                        the use of Lagos Local or the Service by users who are not professional purchasers, sellers,
                        collectors and resellers of items or accessories.

                    <div>
                        You understand that all advertisements, postings, messages, text, files, images, photos, video,
                        sounds, or other materials (“Content”) posted on, transmitted through, or linked from the Service
                        are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. More specifically, you
                        are entirely responsible for each individual item of Content that you post, email or otherwise make
                        available via the Service. Likewise, if you request the assistance of Lagos Local to post content,
                        or if you imply consent that Lagos Local may post content on your behalf, either by written or oral
                        means, or you fail to inform Lagos Local that content should be removed, you are equally responsible
                        for the content. You waive any and all claims against Lagos Local of a right of publicity for your
                        image or likeness throughout the world by posting any information or pictures of yourself on Lagos
                        Local. You understand that Lagos Local does not control, and is not responsible for personal Content
                        made available through the Service, and that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content
                        that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. When you post User
                        Content to the Service, you authorize and direct us to make such copies thereof as we deem necessary
                        in order to facilitate the posting and storage of the Content on the Service. By posting Content to
                        any part of the Service, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the
                        right to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid,
                        worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display,
                        reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such Content for any purpose on or
                        in connection with the Service or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or
                        incorporate into other works, such Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of the foregoing.
